* The purpose is for me to create content on a regular basis, to tell people aboout my personal journey. ould be refelecting on some past experience, travelling, itopic of interest or something I learned on the context of current professional/educational projects

* Best way to do it is host it on WordPress but that will depend of how easy it will be to integrated with a github page and make it a subdomain. 

*If WordPress does not work out, I will need to build an easy and intuive templating CMS to incorporate on the website
